title: Vercel keeps warning me to update Node.js
date: '2025-08-13'

I keep getting emails from Vercel (twice!) that this site is running on Node.js version 18. It will no longer be supported starting 2025-09-01. I thought I had already changed the configuration.

## Configuring Node version in Vercel

On the project page

1. Top Menu: Settings
2. Side Menu: Build and Deployment
3. Under Node.js Version, change it to 22.x

## Still getting emails

Since I'm still getting emails, I decide that I must push an update so it's truly updated. Since I don't want to just push _nothing_ I'm writing up this tiny post on how to update the Node.js version!
